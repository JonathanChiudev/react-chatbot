# MERN-ChatBot


This is a small project to practice a MERN stack and to learn how to make a chatbot with the DialogFlow from Google Cloud Platform. It is still under development so more features are coming soon! Stay tuned! :D

### There are two environments with independent databases:

**Production** (MASTER branch): https://mern-chatbot.herokuapp.com/

**Pre-production** (DEVEL branch): https://mern-chatbot-pre.herokuapp.com/

I will appreciate a lot your feedback and your opinion about the project. Feel free to create an issue or to contact me via LinkedIn, mail or social networks.
Thank you in advance!
